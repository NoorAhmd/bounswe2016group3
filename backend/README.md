In order to build, test and run this project, you only need JVM, JDK (At least 1.8) and Maven. Maven downloads the rest of the dependencies. You also need a postgresql database with a database called test accessible by the user info located in the conf.yml. Every maven-related command that follows need to be executed in the directory that contains the pom.xml file (i.e. this one). In order to be able to edit the project on eclipse, run ```mvn eclipse:eclipse```. To test the code by running the test cases, run ```mvn test```. To build the project, run ```mvn package```, which also runs the tests. After you've built the project, you first need to set the database up by running ```java -jar target/backend-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar db migrate conf.yml```. After setting up the database, run the API server by executing ```java -jar target/backend-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar server conf.yml```. By default, the server will run at port 8080, you can also access the admin functionality via port 8081.
